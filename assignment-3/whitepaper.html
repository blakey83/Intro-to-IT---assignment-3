      <h5>Project Overview &mdash;</h5>
      <h3 class="data1H3">Topic</h3>

      <h3 class="data1H3">Motivation</h3>
      <p class="mainTextData"></p>

      <h3 class="data1H3">Landscape</h3>
      <p class="mainTextData"></p>

      <h5>Project Description &mdash;</h5>
      <h3 class="data1H3">Aims</h3>
      <p class="mainTextData">Our project aims to have a market-ready translation application to be used in restaurants around the world. To achieve this, we have broken up our project into 4 phases. Each phase will have goals and deliverables required to pass to the next phase.</p>
      <p class="mainTextData">Phase 1 was the planning phase, where we decided on an application and investigated the tools and technology to deliver it. Phase 2 is the sales phase. We are refining our application based on feedback, creating a video outlining the business objectives, and creating deliverables that ensure our product looks marketable. Phase 3 is the prototype phase, in which we will secure the infrastructure needed to build the app, write the code and create a working application—one that can translate! Finally, phase 4 is the test and release phase. We will beta test the prototype during this phase and receive feedback on improvements and bugs in the software. Beyond this, we will begin marketing the product, releasing a limited number of preview versions, and establishing a continuous improvement model to ensure that the app is as good as it can be when released on 8th February 2022.</p>
      <h3 class="data2H3">Phase 1: Ends 23rd April 2021</h3>
      <p class="mainTextData">Our first goal for phase 1 was to produce a comprehensive written report including a complete description of the application, the motivations behind it, and the tools and technology needed to bring it to life. The report will ensure that we have all the relevant information in one place to move to phase 2 of our plan.</p>
      <p class="mainTextData">Another phase 1 goal is to have a functional website dedicated to the project. This website will reflect the information contained in the report. The website is an essential step in our project, as it allows us to share our ideas with the world, bring on investors, and be our first steps in marketing the product.</p>
      <h3 class="data2H3">Phase 2: Ends 28th May 2021</h3>
      <p class="mainTextData">In phase 2, the first goal is to write up a second report. This report will provide more nuance and detail regarding the planned operation and incorporation of feedback received during the rollout of the phase 1 report. This report is crucial as it allows us to refine our plans and our product and demonstrate significant growth in the project.</p>
      <p class="mainTextData">We will produce an informational video for the completion of phase 2. The video will include a description of the application, its motivations and objectives, and how our application differentiates from other translation services. The video is an important marketing tool and is available to send out to investors and other relevant stakeholders.</p>
      <p class="mainTextData">Phase 2 will require the team to create a model of how the application will look on a user's device. The process will involve using Figma to provide an interactive interface prototype. The model is another critical step in showing relevant stakeholders and potential customers how the app will look and feel upon release.</p>
      <h3 class="data2H3">Phase 3: Ends 6th August 2021</h3>
      <p class="mainTextData">The primary goal for phase 3 will be to have a working prototype by completion. The process will involve procuring the needed infrastructure and completing the development to run working translations. Prototype completion is crucial as we need the application to function adequately to begin testing and further secure funding for testing and marketing.</p>
      <h3 class="data2H3">Phase 4: Ends 8th February 2022</h3>
      <p class="mainTextData">By the end of phase 4, we will need to have a tested and working application ready for market. We will need to complete beta testing and fix any bugs or issues to ensure we can launch the application at a professional standard. Market launch is essential, as we will need to start generating income beyond the launch to pay back investors and ourselves.</p>
      <p class="mainTextData">By the end of phase 4 of the project, we should have a comprehensive ongoing marketing plan. Marketing will involve having detailed digital marketing strategies and ongoing customer engagement. After launch, we must know how we will grow the business and have documented plans to showcase our application to the world.</p>
      <p class="mainTextData">Our final goal for the end of phase 4 is to institute a continuous improvement plan. Continuous improvement ensures that all customer feedback can be stored, collated, and acted upon promptly. This is important as our application exists in a competitive landscape, and continuous improvement is the only way we can stay ahead of any potential future competitors.</p>

      <h3 class="data1H3">Plans and Progress</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-8">
          <p class="mainTextData">On the 30th of March 2021, six total strangers met online for the first time. We came together to investigate careers in IT, learn about technology and conceive a viable IT project idea. With six diverse ideas on the table, we decided that the most feasible option was a language translation application that allows written translation from one web-enabled device to another using near field communication (NFC). Our application was to be called UMI.</p>
          <h3 class="data2H3">Early Plans</h3>
          <p class="mainTextData">The first iteration of our project was a language translation application that could translate messages between people using Near Field communications. Customers would download the application onto their mobile devices and exchange messages to communicate across language barriers. Our early design work involved having an application available for both Android and Apple but using a standard back-end design.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">The end-user will download the application onto their device (or load the web page if on a computer), where the application will prompt them to log in or create a new account. Once logged in, the user can submit text or documents they wish to translate into another language.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">The application will send uploaded documents to the webserver through the Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) server. The web server will then send the documents to the application server, converting, via an API, into SQL data stored onto the user database.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">The application will then convert the document into text and send it to the NMT server to translate. The NMT server will use wordnet databases in both the original and target language. The translated text will then return to the application server to convert back into a document. It will be stored on the user database and will be available to the user for future use.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">The user can then share the message with anyone they wish, in any language they wish. In addition, the app supports the use of Near Field Communication (NFC) to exchange information between users. So, for example, if a user has a document or message they wish to share with another user in a different language, they can submit the original document to the app and then share a link to the second user through NFC. The second user will send a request to the application server, which pulls the original text, passing it to the NMT server for translation. The translated text is subsequently returned to the second user via the web server HTTP link to their device.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">However, after conducting preliminary primary market research (interviewing family, friends, and co-workers), it was concluded that requiring strangers to tap their phones together in circumstances where they could not communicate would be difficult. There are both real and perceived security threats; the theft of data and cultural misunderstandings would make things particularly difficult. The group decided this would not be a marketable product in the real world.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <img class = "figures" src="Images/figure1.png" alt="Figure1" width="280" height="300">
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-8">
          <h3 class="data2H3">UMI 2.0</h3>
          <p class="mainTextData">The team unanimously concluded that the original idea would need to pivot to create a marketable solution. The group met and floated many ideas, including weighing the possibility of entirely changing the project idea. Nevertheless, the group decided that the original idea, although flawed, had merit, not to mention the considerable research and work the team had invested into this idea. After some collective spit balling, the team decided to proceed with an idea to modify the app to service the hospitality industry. The assumption was that a customer who does not speak the language of a particular restaurant would have a significantly better dining experience if they could instantly translate menu information with a simple tap of their phone. The team hypothesised that the customer would download the venue's menu by tapping their mobile device onto an NFC reader installed at the restaurant with the translated menu being transmitted to their phone. The customer would subsequently return their order to the restaurant with any notes or changes, with the application translating the text back into the language of the restaurant.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">This pivot requires us to make changes to the front-end design. These include making the app more geared toward a web browser model for restaurants, ensuring that our product could fit into existing infrastructure, and investigating NFC readers that would work on USB. Our approach was now to have two distinct functionalities: downloading a menu and making an order. </p>
          <p class="mainTextData">Restauranteurs will need access to a computer connected to the worldwide web to log into our HTML web page. From here, they can upload menus, show previous orders, and, most importantly, ensure the customer's billing details are up to date. First, the restaurant client will upload the menu to the
          HTTP server, which passes it to the Application server, who then converts it to the SQL format and stores it on the Client database. </p>
          <p class="mainTextData">The restaurant customer will open the application on their NFC-enabled device and then tapping their phone onto the NFC device installed at the restaurant's counter. A request will then be sent through the webserver to the application server to retrieve the restaurant's menu. Next, the text will be sent, along with the user's language information, to the Neuro Machine translation (NMT) server. The NMT server will then use the NMT algorithm to choose words from the user's language wordnet database to translate the menu into the user's language. Finally, the app will send a translation to the user via the HTTP server.</p>

      </div>

      <h3 class="data2H3">Component Details</h3>
      <p class="whitepaperSubHeading">Front End Development</h3>
      <p class="mainTextData">The front end is the user interface, usually a web page for the restaurant user or through an app on their phone for the customer. Once signed in, the user has a landing screen. From here, they can see their account information in their language. Once the customer requests a menu, a translated version of the menu will be made available. Translation can be completed automatically through the app, with the preferred method being a data transfer via near field communication (NFC). Once the device has tapped the NFC hotspot, it will connect to the app's web server and download the menu in the language of the user's choice.</p>
      <p class="mainTextData">The website and mobile app should be designed and developed in tandem. The development will require the X code coding suite to develop the iPhone App (Ching, 2019), Android studio for the Android version (TheZachBales, n.d.) In addition, we will create Web pages with a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Cox, 2020).</p>

      <p class="whitepaperSubHeading">Near Field Communication</h3>
      <p class="mainTextData">Near Field Communication (NFC) devices allow the peer-to-peer transfer of secure information between two clients in the same geographical location (Sauter, 2016). Our app is about communication between a hospitality business and potential customers.</p>
      <p class="mainTextData">As the restaurant side would mainly be using PC or laptops already, there would be a need for them to purchase an NFC reader for around $60 (Square Reader, n.d.). To program the NFC Reader for the app, they will need to be encoded for around 25c per tag with Go-to tag encoder (Go To. n.d.)</p>

      <p class="whitepaperSubHeading">Web Server</h3>
      <p class="mainTextData">The app requires a connection to the internet to send and receive data from the client to the app's back end. Therefore, UMI needs a Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) connection over the world wide web that connects to the web server in the cloud (Schuler, 2002). The client can request data such as database information and photos.</p>
      <p class="mainTextData">After researching various options, including buying and setting up the UMI server, the team concluded that using a cloud service was preferable. Apache with the Ubuntu web server is one of the oldest and most popular HTTP server Infrastructure as a service (IAAS) products on the market (AWS 2021, a) and, as such, is the preferred option.</p>

      <p class="whitepaperSubHeading">Application Server, APIs and Customer Database </h3>
      <p class="mainTextData">The application server is the real brains of the operation. It is here that the front-end makes requests for information, and the requests are processed. For example, suppose a client wishes to add a document to the database. In that case, the application server will request and add the relevant metadata to ensure the user can access the document in the future. (IT pro team, 2018).</p>
      <p class="mainTextData">UMI's application server will require the project to have an application programming interface (API) between the HTTP server and the Neural Machine Translation sever. Amazon offers an NMT solution and API that UMI could use.  In addition, Amazon translate is a scalable solution for the product, perfect for UMI's business needs (AWS 2021, b). The project team also investigated using Microsoft Azure, which priced similarly (Azure 2021); however, the team concluded that Amazon Web Service (AWS) better suited the business growth plan.</p>
      <p class="mainTextData">Additionally, UMI will require an Application Programming Interface to facilitate application to customer service information and menu data, billing data, and personal preferences into a logical database system. The team decided that the best way forward was to bundle services with AWS, as they were competitive on price. Consolidating UMI's APIs and IAAS within the same company could be beneficial when looking at it from an interoperability perspective. The slash DB product creates automated APIs for relational databases (AWS 2021, c). As a result, the application can store and pull data quickly and create new features for UMI's customers. </p>

      <h3 class="data2H3">Project Deliverables</h3>
      <p class="mainTextData">So far, the project has made several plans and had numerous discussions around what it plans to achieve. The team is currently working on various deliverables to ensure a smooth transition into the project's next phase. First, the team has produced a Figma prototype so that potential investors and customers can experience the product's interface before UMI commences development. The prototype is an interactive mock-up of UMI's mobile application, with working buttons and menus.</p>
      <p class="mainTextData">The team has also created a professional video presentation, which will demonstrate what the application does. This video represents a further opportunity for all stakeholders, future customers and potential investors. </p>
      <p class="mainTextData">Other deliverables include a detailed project scope statement—The Scope of Works document. With a definite project scope, managers can easily stay on track and achieve all deadlines throughout the project life cycle (Kissflow, 2021). The project scope statement defines the limitations of the project, breaks down the work, and ensures that all stakeholders are clear on objectives (Kissflow, 2021).</p>

      <h3 class="data2H3">Future</h3>
      <p class="mainTextData">The team has divided the project into 4 phases. The first phase was to bring the group together, develop a workable idea, investigate the design, investigate the tools and technology, and put forward a detailed description of the application. During this time, the team spent time collectively investigating IT technologies, careers and creating group processes.</p>
      <p class="mainTextData">Phase 2, the current phase, is about refining the team's output. The team has determined key deliverables and adhered to established internal processes in achieving them. The team has refined the product with considerable research invested in uncovering ways to improve the implementation of the translation service and how to develop a working prototype in phase 3. </p>
      <img class = "figuresLarge" src="Images/figure4.png" alt="Figure4" width="600" height="400">
      <p class="mainTextData">Phase 3 is primarily concerned with the creation of a working prototype. The team expects this to take place over ten weeks, from the 31st May through to 6th August 2021. The idea would be to divide up the team between the front-end and back-end development. Thus, the project would run as a series of sprints—goals for each sprint to back up the overall aim.</p>
      <p class="mainTextData">Phase 4 is the final stage and involves taking the working prototype and creating a market-ready product. The most crucial part of this phase is beta testing. Testing will allow the team to improve and refine the code to be the best it can be at launch. The phase will last from 8th August until a launch date that will be 8th February 2022.</p>

          <h3 class="data2H3">The Restaurant</h3>
          <p class="mainTextData">When the end-user is a hospitality business, the user will access UMI's HTML dashboard via the world wide web. First, the web page will present the user with a login screen, prompting them to sign in to an existing account or create a new one. Once the user has completed the login process, the web page will display a unique landing page specific to the restaurant. From here, users can upload menu images and descriptions, view previous orders, manage billing details, and more. Upon uploading a menu item, the HTTP server will transfer it to the application server, which then converts the information to SQL format and stores the file on the client database (fig. 2).</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-8">
          <h3 class="data2H3">The Customer</h3>
          <p class="mainTextData">When the end-user is a customer, the UMI application is downloaded directly to their device from the App Store. Subsequently, the user will reach the App's landing page and be prompted to log in or create a new account, requiring an internet connection to the UMI web server. Once logged in, the user can view their account details, such as the user's name, address, billing information and the primary language spoken. The user server provides this information which the application server then retrieves—finally, the HTTP server processing the information through the world wide web (Fig. 3)</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">When a customer visits a restaurant, they can use UMI to obtain a copy of the menu in their preferred language. They achieve this by opening the application on their NFC-enabled device and tapping their phone at the corresponding NFC device on the restaurant's counter. This action will initiate a request through the web server to the application server that tells the application to retrieve the restaurant menu. </p>
          <p class="mainTextData">Once the information is retrieved, the application server will transfer the data to the Neuro Machine Translation (NMT) server. The NMT server will subsequently apply UMI's NMT algorithm to translate the text using the WordNet database. Upon completion, the HTTP server will return the translated text to the user (Fig. 4)</p>

        </div>
      </div> -->



      <h3 class="data1H3">Skills</h3>
      <p class="mainTextData">As UMI is a high-end project, the business requires highly skilled individuals in its arsenal. The below personnel will be instrumental in ensuring a robust end product is delivered. Some of these will require more than one person in a role, and conversely, one person may be able to contribute to multiple areas.</p>
      <h3 class="data2H3">Graphic Designer</h3>
      <p class="mainTextData">An experienced graphic designer with UX & UI experience is required to ensure user-facing apps and web design is current, sleek, intuitive, and professional. UMI exists in a competitive market and without a physical product, meaning the design and branding are of paramount importance. UMI will lean heavily on the design team to ensure the Brand's mission, ethos, tone, and objectives communicated across all marketing collateral and digital assets whilst maintaining UX best practices throughout all interfaces and dashboards (Malvick 2020).</p>

      <h3 class="data2H3">Front End Developer</h3>
      <p class="mainTextData">An expert Front End Developer is needed to create functional user-facing content for UMI's mobile applications and restaurant-facing website. Working closely with the design team, the Front End Developer will bring functionality to UMI's interfaces, ensuring an intuitive and user-friendly experience. They will be proficient in CSS, HTML, Xcode, and JavaScript languages and demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of API, Python, and version control protocols (Gallagher 2020).</p>

      <h3 class="data2H3">Back End Developer</h3>
      <p class="mainTextData">An exceptionally skilled Back End Developer is essential to ensuring that the UMI Application functions as intended and that all systems communicate adequately using application programming interfaces (Gibbs 2019). The Back End Developer will program the user database, the application server, the web server and the neural machine translation and, as such, will require aptitude in several programming languages. They will require knowledge of Database programming languages such as MySQL, MongoDB, SQLServer (guru 99, n.d.). For programming and customizing APIs they will require a good understanding of REST and SOAP languages (guru 99, n.d.). For setting up the servers they would also need to program in Apache, or some other server language(guru 99, n.d.)</p>

      <h3 class="data2H3">Project Manager</h3>
      <p class="mainTextData">UMI requires an experienced Project Manager with exceptional leadership and communication skills, analysis expertise, and a firm grasp of budgeting, planning, and management best practices to see the Project through from ideation to completion. Responsible for managing deadlines, human resources, risk management and stakeholder communication (Landau 2019). The successful candidate will preferably hold a relevant Bachelor's degree or adequate experience in the field.</p>

      <h3 class="data2H3">Marketing Manager</h3>
      <p class="mainTextData">An expert Marketing Manager is essential for UMI to generate enough revenue to cover the development costs and turn a profit. To achieve hyper-growth and to reach its target audience, a multi-faceted approach to marketing endeavours is pertinent. The Marketing Manager must demonstrate comprehensive proficiency with digital marketing strategy, Google Ads and analytics, Facebook Ads, PR, marketing research, consumer trends, brand positioning, and SEO/SEM best practices (Farkash 2020). Proficiency with Google Search Console, Analytics and Tag Manager, and Facebook Business Manager.</p>

      <h3 class="data2H3">Finance and Accounting Manager</h3>
      <p class="mainTextData">The project will need to be financed by investors with start-up capital. The finance manager (FM) is responsible for finding start up capital funds so that the app can be started. The FM is then responsible to ensure that each part of the project is running to budget. The FM works closely with the project manager to ensure that the budget is on schedule, and is also responsible for producing financial records for all relevant stakeholders.</p>

      <h3 class="data2H3">Additional Personal</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Finance & Accounting Manager to oversee investor relations and manage company funds.</li>
        <li>National Sales Director to formulate UMI's sales strategies and lead the nationwide sales team.</li>
        <li>Brand Manager to monitor consumer demands and ensure consistency across companywide communications and marketing.</li>
        <li>IT Security Officer to manage security protocols and liaise with consultants and analysts external to the business.</li>
